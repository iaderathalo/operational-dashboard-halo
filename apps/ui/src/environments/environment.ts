// This client ID value only gets used for local development (unlike environment.prod.ts which is used in the dev/prod-preview/prod envs).
// The values in environment.prod.ts get replaced with values from Vault by the Entrypoint script. We can't use the Entrypoint script locally because it needs to connect to Vault using Kubernetes auth (which we can't do locally).
// If we want this find/replace on the environment.ts, we'll need a different mechanism.
// Ultimately this only removes the value from the repo, anyone that goes to the deployed Blueprint site will be able to look at the source code and get this value.
